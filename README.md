The overarching goal of the analysis is to generate an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that can be used to predict whether or not an individual has an income of over $50K per year. The analysis will make use of US Census Bureau data. As analysts we want to identify the demographic characteristics that are best suited for this prediction. For each observation in the US Census Bureau training data, there are fourteen given predictors such as age and work-class, and the target variable - income.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
On the training set, we achieved a maximum prediction accuracy of 84.848% with 25 neurons which was selected by conducting cross validation on the data set. The most important predictors in the ANN were “education-num,” which is the number of years of education, and “capital-gain.” In part two, when we graduated to the big leagues of data mining, we split the training data into training and validation datasets. We achieved an accuracy rate of  85.06% with 29 neurons on validation set. This same model was thereafter used to predict the outcomes of whether the income for observations in the test dataset was higher than $50K or not.                                                        
We also calculated the weights of each input variable to determine feature importance.
